            <li>Please be do not be rude when communicating with me, ill behavior will not be tolerated.</li>
            <li>Please be clear with your request. The less references I am given, the more creative liberties I will take.</li>
            <li>If you give me a deadline that I cannot complete your request by, I will turn it down. Unless I have specified otherwise, the default deadline is 3 months.</li>
            <li>If I anticipate that the time will extend beyond the deadline due to (e.g. commissions I am currently working on/work/personal matters) I will notify you ASAP.</li>
            <li>If you fail to follow the rules I have provided, I reserve the right to decline your commission.</li>

            <li>Payment is accepted through Ko-fi at <a href="https://ko-fi.com/ratfestival">ko-fi.com/ratfestival</a>, or through Paypal to ratfestival.art@gmail.com</li>
            <li>All pricing and accepted currency is in USD.</li>

        </ul>

        <h1>III) PROCESS</h1>
        <h2>For Ko-fi Commissions Only</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You make a tip through Ko-fi and contact me with references for your character and your preferred method of contact.</li>
            <li>I create the requested piece, and reach out if I have any questions, or turn down and refund the request if I have any concerns.</li>
            <li>I send the completed files for review. If there are any concerns I can make small changes, however there are no refunds at this stage.</li>
            <li>The commission is complete!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>All Other Commissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You reach out with the details of your request. (size, polish, deadline, etc.)</li>
            <li>I respond whether or not I am capable of taking your request, what I can draw for you, or suggest any simplifications to make to work within your budget.</li>
            <li>If you accept, you pay either upfront or half before, and half after I've completed the commissioned piece.</li>
            <li>Accept or turn down the offer (No lowballing please! I'd rather be turned down!).</li>
            <li>I start working on your piece. Since I've started drawing/researching at this stage, you cannot request a refund.</li>
            <li>I show you my thumbnail sketches, and you let me know what you think, and send any more reference pictures. NOTE: This is the last time to make any changes!</li>
            <li>I will proceed in the direction you chose, occasionally show you my progress, and communicate with you if I have any uncertainties.</li>
            <li>I'll show you the finished piece and make any small tweaks. (nothing too drastic, I can move a finger, adjust the eyebrows, or shift the colors if it's a colored piece, but if you want to change the entire pose I'd be doing 2 commissions)</li>
            <li>You approve and send the other half of the payment if you sent half before.</li>
            <li>I send you the completed files.</li>
            <li>The commission is complete!</li>
        </ul>
